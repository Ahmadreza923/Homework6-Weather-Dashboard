Create multiple functions within your application to handle the different parts of the dashboard:

  * Current conditions
  
  * 5-Day Forecast
  
  * Search history

  * UV index

* You will need to make more than one AJAX call.

* You will need to hardcode some of the parameters in the API's URL. User input will determine some of the other parameters.

* Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
